## What are a sticky footer and header?

A sticky footer "sticks" to the bottom of the viewport in cases where the content is shorter than the viewport height.

A fixed header also known as a sticky header remain at the top of the page as a user scrolls up and down. In other words, the header and site navigation are always on the top of the scrolled page.
