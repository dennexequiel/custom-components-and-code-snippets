## Folder Structure

- **Top-level folders** are the `CATEGORIES` of the code snippets.
- Under each category will be a **sub-folder** for each snippet.
- Within the sub-folder, will be one **readme.md** file that best describes the code snippet.

Example:
| Top-Level Folder | Sub-folder      | Files        |
| ---------------- |-----------------|--------------|
| Bootstrap        | Navbar          | Readme.md    |
|                  |                 | Index.html   |

Thank you, and happy hacking!
