## Folder Structure

- **Top-level folders** are the `CATEGORIES` of the code snippets.
- Under each category will be a **sub-folder** for snippets/components. A sub-folder can have sub-folders if needed.
- Within the code snippet/component will be one **readme.md** file that best describes the code snippet/component.

Example:
| Top-level Folder | Sub-folder        |                   |            |            |
