## Typewriter Effect

This code snippet lets you display a set of typewriter-effect words in an HTML element with class attribute with a value of "typewriter-element".

Note: If you want to add or delete words, go to the app.js and update the array named "phrases."

Example:
```
<h1 class="typewriter-element"></h1>
```
