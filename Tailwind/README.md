## What Is Tailwind CSS?
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. Rather than focusing on the functionality of the item being styled, Tailwind is centered around how it should be displayed.
